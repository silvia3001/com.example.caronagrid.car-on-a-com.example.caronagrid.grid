Remote Controlled Cars.

Cars are placed on a 15 by 15 grid at particular co-ordinates heading north, and the simple commands Left, right and forward are transmitted to them. The commands must be executed and the final position calculated.
The following examples should be used to demonstrate your code:

For the input "5,5:RFLFRFLF"
We should get the position "7,7"

For the input "6,6:FFLFFLFFLFF"
We should get the position "6,6"

For the input "5,5:FLFLFFRFFF"
We should get the position "4,1"
